## Description

In contrast to traditional data processing systems that provide one dedicated execution engine, Apache Wayang (incubating) can transparently and seamlessly integrate multiple execution engines and use them to perform a single task. We call this *cross-platform data processing*. In Wayang, users can specify any data processing application using one of Wayang's APIs and then Wayang will choose the data processing platform(s), e.g., Postgres or Apache Spark, that best fits the application. Finally, Wayang will perform the execution, thereby hiding the different platform-specific APIs and coordinating inter-platform communication.

Apache Wayang (incubating) aims at freeing data engineers and software developers from the burden of learning all different data processing systems, their APIs, strengths and weaknesses; the intricacies of coordinating and integrating different processing platforms; and the inflexibility when trying a fixed set of processing platforms. As of now, Wayang has built-in support for the following processing platforms:
- [Java Streams](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html)
- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
- [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/)
- [Apache Giraph](https://giraph.apache.org/)
- [GraphChi](https://github.com/GraphChi/graphchi-java)
- [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

Apache Wayang (incubating) can be used via the following APIs:
- Java scala-like
- Scala
- SQL
- Java native (recommended only for low level)

## Quick Guide for Running Wayang

For a quick guide on how to run WordCount see [here](guides/tutorial.md).

## Quick Guide for Developing with Wayang

For a quick guide on how to use Wayang in your Java/Scala project see [here](guides/develop-with-Wayang.md).

## Installing Wayang

You first have to build the binaries as shown [here](guides/tutorial.md).
Once you have the binaries built, follow these steps to install Wayang:

```shell
tar -xvf wayang-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
cd wayang-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

In linux
```shell
echo "export WAYANG_HOME=$(pwd)" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=${PATH}:${WAYANG_HOME}/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
In MacOS
```shell
echo "export WAYANG_HOME=$(pwd)" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "export PATH=${PATH}:${WAYANG_HOME}/bin" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Requirements at Runtime

Apache Wayang (incubating) relies on external execution engines and Java to function correctly. Below are the updated runtime requirements:

- **Java 17**: Make sure `JAVA_HOME` is correctly set to your Java 17 installation.
- **Apache Spark 3.4.4**: Compatible with Scala 2.12. Set the `SPARK_HOME` environment variable.
- **Apache Hadoop 3+**: Set the `HADOOP_HOME` environment variable.

> üõ†Ô∏è **Note:** When using Java 17, you _must_ add JVM flags to allow Wayang and Spark to access internal Java APIs, or you will encounter `IllegalAccessError`. See below.

### Validating the installation

To execute your first application with Apache Wayang, you need to execute your program with the 'wayang-submit' command:

```shell
bin/wayang-submit org.apache.wayang.apps.wordcount.Main java file://$(pwd)/README.md
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Java 17 Compatibility

When running Wayang applications using Java 17 (especially with Spark), you must add JVM flags to open specific internal Java modules. These flags resolve access issues with `sun.nio.ch.DirectBuffer` and others.

Update your `wayang-submit` (wayang-assembly/target/wayang-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT/bin/wayang-submit) script (or command) with:

```bash
eval "$RUNNER \
  --add-exports=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens=java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens=java.base/java.lang.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens=java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens=java.base/java.net=ALL-UNNAMED \
  --add-opens=java.base/java.lang.invoke=ALL-UNNAMED \
  $FLAGS -cp \"${WAYANG_CLASSPATH}\" $CLASS ${ARGS}"
```

## Getting Started

Wayang is available via Maven Central. To use it with Maven, include the following code snippet into your POM file:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.wayang</groupId>
  <artifactId>wayang-***</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
Note the `***`: Wayang ships with multiple modules that can be included in your app, depending on how you want to use it:
* `wayang-core`: provides core data structures and the optimizer (required)
* `wayang-basic`: provides common operators and data types for your apps (recommended)
* `wayang-api-scala-java`: provides an easy-to-use Scala and Java API to assemble Wayang plans (recommended)
* `wayang-java`, `wayang-spark`, `wayang-graphchi`, `wayang-sqlite3`, `wayang-postgres`: adapters for the various supported processing platforms
* `wayang-profiler`: provides functionality to learn operator and UDF cost functions from historical execution data

> **NOTE:** The module `wayang-api-scala-java` is intended to be used with Java 11 and Scala 2.12.

For the sake of version flexibility, you still have to include in the POM file your Hadoop (`hadoop-hdfs` and `hadoop-common`) and Spark (`spark-core` and `spark-graphx`) version of choice.

In addition, you can obtain the most recent snapshot version of Wayang via Sonatype's snapshot repository. Just include:
```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>apache-snapshots</id>
    <name>Apache Foundation Snapshot Repository</name>
    <url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

### Prerequisites
Apache Wayang (incubating) is built with Java 17 and Scala 2.12. However, to run Apache Wayang it is sufficient to have just Java 17 installed. Please also consider that processing platforms employed by Wayang might have further requirements.
```
Java 17
Scala 2.12.17
Spark 3.4.4, Compatible with Scala 2.12.
Maven
```

> **NOTE:** In windows, you need to define the variable `HADOOP_HOME` with the winutils.exe, an not official option to obtain [this repository](https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils), or you can generate your winutils.exe following the instructions in the repository. Also, you may need to install [msvcr100.dll](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999)

> **NOTE:** Make sure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set correctly to Java 17 as the prerequisite checker script currently supports up to Java 17 and checks the latest version of Java if you have higher version installed. In Linux, it is preferably to use the export JAVA_HOME method inside the project folder. It is also recommended running './mvnw clean install' before opening the project using IntelliJ.


### Building

If you need to rebuild Wayang, e.g., to use a different Scala version, you can simply do so via Maven:

1. Adapt the version variables (e.g., `spark.version`) in the main `pom.xml` file.
2. Build Wayang with the adapted versions.
    ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-wayang.git
   cd incubator-wayang
   ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
    ```
> **NOTE:** If you receive an error about not finding `MathExBaseVisitor`, then the problem might be that you are trying to build from IntelliJ, without Maven. MathExBaseVisitor is generated code, and a Maven build should generate it automatically.

> **NOTE:**: In the current Maven setup, Wayang supports Java 17. The default Scala version is 2.12.17, which is compatible with Java 17. Ensure that your Spark distribution is also built with Scala 2.12 (e.g., `spark-3.4.4-bin-hadoop3-scala2.12`).

> **NOTE:** For compiling and testing the code it is required to have Hadoop installed on your machine.

> **NOTE:**  the `standalone` profile to fix Hadoop and Spark versions, so that Wayang apps do not explicitly need to declare the corresponding dependencies.

> **NOTE**: When running applications (e.g., WordCount) with Java 17, you must pass additional flags to allow internal module access:

>--add-exports=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED \
--add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED \
--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED \
--add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED \
--add-opens=java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED \
--add-opens=java.base/java.lang.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED \
--add-opens=java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED \
--add-opens=java.base/java.net=ALL-UNNAMED \
--add-opens=java.base/java.lang.invoke=ALL-UNNAMED \

>
> Also, note the `distro` profile, which assembles a binary Wayang distribution.
To activate these profiles, you need to specify them when running maven, i.e.,

```shell
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -P<profile name>
```

## Running the tests
In the incubator-wayang root folder run:
```shell
./mvnw test
```
